This project involves creating a 2D game similar to PACMAN using the MLX library.

The primary focus of the project is on map parsing, which constitutes 70% of the work. 

Additionally, 20% of the project involves event handling

Remaining tasks include finding and implementing appropriate images and other minor elements.

The project includes validation checks for maps to ensure correct parsing correctly in maps file.

I hope you find this project enjoyable!
