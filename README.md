This project involves creating a 2D game similar to PACMAN using the MLX library with OpenGL support. The game is currently playable only on systems that support OpenGL. The primary focus of the project is on map parsing, which constitutes 70% of the work. Additionally, 10% of the project involves event handling, while the remaining tasks include finding and implementing appropriate images and other minor elements. The project includes validation checks for maps to ensure correct parsing, differentiating between valid and invalid maps.

I hope you find this project enjoyable!
